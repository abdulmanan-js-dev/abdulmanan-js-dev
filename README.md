### 👨‍💻 About Me  
I'm a developer actively building my way into the **full-stack world**.  
Right now, I have a strong foundation in:

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

- Writing clean, organized, and beginner-friendly code

And I'm currently leveling up my backend journey with:

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **REST APIs**
- **MongoDB (MERN Stack Path)**

I love learning by building real things, improving daily, and documenting my journey.
